# Hinglish Prompting Strategy - 100 Word Explanation

To achieve natural Hinglish conversations, I explicitly requested code-switching with interruption words in a specific ratio for each language. The prompt includes: 
(1) instruction to mix languages naturally throughout the dialogue, 
(2) Keep the language dignified, with no unparliamentary, or undignified language, and only gentle pause or interruptions. 
(2) conversational interruptions like "umm", "achcha", "haan", "yeah" are to be kept not too informal, to keep the podcast a bit tight and good for publishing. 
(3) temperature 0.8 for natural flow, 
(4) JSON format with speaker labels, and 
(5) example output showing desired style. 

Emphasizes "natural, conversational scripts" rather than formal translations. This ensures authentic bilingual dialogue that mirrors real speech patterns, with seamless language transitions and natural pauses. The key is treating Hinglish as a natural language variant, not a translation task, which otherwise produces robotic output.
