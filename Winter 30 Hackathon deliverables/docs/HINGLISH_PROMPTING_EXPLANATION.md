# Hinglish Prompting Strategy - 100 Word Explanation

To achieve natural Hinglish conversations, the LLM prompt explicitly requests code-switching with interruption words. The prompt includes: (1) instruction to mix languages naturally throughout the dialogue, (2) conversational interruptions like "umm", "achcha", "haan", "yeah", (3) temperature 0.8 for natural flow, (4) JSON format with speaker labels, and (5) example output showing desired style. The system message emphasizes "natural, conversational scripts" rather than formal translations. This ensures authentic bilingual dialogue that mirrors real speech patterns, with seamless language transitions and natural pauses. The key is treating Hinglish as a natural language variant, not a translation task, which otherwise produces robotic output.
